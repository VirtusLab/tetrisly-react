## Tech Stack

- [React 18](https://react.dev/)
- [xstyled](https://xstyled.dev/)

We've desided to use `xstyled` for styling our components. If you are interested in our reasoning, check out our article on this topic: [Style Wars: Tailwind vs. CSS-in-JS in Design Systems Implementation](https://medium.com/tetrisly/style-wars-tailwind-vs-css-in-js-in-design-systems-implementation-de6015ee2695)

## Installation

Install my-project with npm (you can do the same with yarn, pnpm or any other package manager)

```bash
  npm install @virtuslab/tetrisly-react
```

## Setup

After installing the package, you need to wrap your application in the `TetrislyProvider` component. This will provide the theme and other context to your application.

```typescript
import { TetrislyProvider } from '@virtuslab/tetrisly-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <TetrislyProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </TetrislyProvider>
  )
}
```

TetrislyProvider accepts optional prop `theme` which can be used to override default theme.

You can check out how this object looks like here: [Tetrisly Theme](src/theme/theme.ts)

```typescript
import { TetrislyProvider } from '@virtuslab/tetrisly-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <TetrislyProvider theme={{ colors: { primary: 'red' } }}>
      <YourApp />
    </TetrislyProvider>
  )
}
```

## Usage/Examples

```typescript
import { Button } from '@virtuslab/tetrisly-react';

function App() {
  return <Button label="Hello Tetrisly" />
}
```
